# Experiments in Blazor

Just some preliminary experiments in using [Blazor](https://learn-blazor.com).
Currently, this is just a basic minesweeper implementation. 

To run:
* [install Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/blazor/get-started?view=aspnetcore-3.0&tabs=netcore-cli)
* clone the repo
* change into the directory
* run `dotnet run`
* go to localhost:5000 (only tested on Chrome and Firefox)
